# Car Dataset Dashboard Analysis 🚗📊

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a car dataset using Microsoft Excel, with **Power Query** and **Power Pivot** for advanced data processing and modeling.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information about various car models such as:

- Make and body style
- Engine specifications (size, horsepower, fuel system)
- Dimensions (length, width, height)
- Performance indicators (mpg, rpm, price)

**Sample attributes:**
- `make`, `fuel-type`, `body-style`, `engine-size`, `horsepower`, `price`, etc.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Performed using **Power Query**:
- Replaced missing or unknown values (e.g., "Unkown") with appropriate entries or nulls
- Converted text-based columns to proper data types
- Removed duplicates and outliers where applicable
- Standardized column names

## 📊 Dashboard Features

Created using **Power Pivot** and Excel PivotTables:
- **KPIs** for average price, horsepower, and fuel efficiency
- Interactive **slicers** for filtering by make, body-style, fuel type, and engine type
- Comparative analysis of city vs. highway mpg
- Price distribution by car manufacturer and engine size

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel (Power Query & Power Pivot)
- PivotTables & PivotCharts
- Data Model with relationships between tables (if used)

## 📷 Screenshots (optional)

You can add screenshots of your dashboard here to visually showcase your work.
