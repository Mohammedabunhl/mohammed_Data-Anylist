## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- **Number of Transactions**: Total count of purchases made.
- **Number of Customers**: Unique customer count based on transaction records.
- **Average Amount Paid**: Overall average per transaction.
- **Top 10 Spending Customers**: Ranked list of customers by total paid amount.
- **Average Amount by Day & Hour**: Time-based trends of spending behavior.
- **Payment Method Analysis**:
  - Classification of customers by payment type.
  - Average amount paid for each method (Credit Card, PayPal, Cash, Bank Transfer).
- **Dynamic Filter by Payment Method**: Enables user to explore data by specific payment types.
