# Agricultural Crop Production Analysis in Canada

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of agricultural crop production and profitability across various geographical regions in Canada. The analysis integrates both programmatic data exploration and interactive visualization to uncover trends, insights, and regional patterns in crop production and value.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

  - `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization and statistical plots

- **Power BI**
  - For building an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

A complete data-cleaning pipeline was performed before analysis, including:

- Handling missing values
- Standardizing crop names and geographical codes
- Removing or correcting inconsistent or duplicated records
- Transforming columns into suitable data types
- Creating derived columns (e.g., average yield, total farm profit)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses & Visualizations

- **Time-series analysis** of farm profit from 1908 to 1984, with trend line
- **Bar plots** for comparing average farm profit per crop and region
- **Yield analysis** by crop type and geographical region
- **KPI cards** summarizing average yield, farm profit, and number of crop types
- **Interactive filters** by crop type, region (GEO), and year (REF_DATE)
- **Horizontal comparisons** to highlight the most and least productive crops and areas

## ðŸ“Œ Insights Gained

- Significant variation in farm profit over time, with a sharp increase in later years
- Certain crops like **Wheat** and **Canola** show consistently high profitability
- Regions such as **PP** and **CA** lead in average profits, while others lag
- **Sugar beets** have the highest average yield despite lower profitability
- Distribution of crops and profitability is uneven across Canada's regions
